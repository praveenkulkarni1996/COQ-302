## About the course COQ302 (2016, Mausam)
* This is a seminar course, one of two that every IIT student must do. It is an **ungraded**, 1 credit course.
 * One of the seminar courses must be from the same department as the student was in, the second can be from any department.
* A seminar course is essentially a communications course which involves attending talks as well as presentations.

This particular seminar course was course coordinated by Mausam, but we were divided into four groups, depending upon our interest. Each group was _handled_ by a different professor.

* Verification, Programming Languages, Compilers - SAK, Subodh Vishnu Sharma
* Theoretical Computer Science, Algorithms - Naveen Garg
* Vision, Machine Learning - Subodh Kumar
* Embedded Systems, Hardware - Preeti Ranjan Panda

I was in the Verification/PL/Compilers group. It was initially going to be handled by SAK, but then he became the HOD, and SVS took over us. I think we were lucky to have SVS because we were the only group to present research papers, and he was very attentive to the presentation. Naveen Garg's group had it next best.

The course required us to spend 24 hours to this course. The breakup is described below.

* Own Group talks -- 12 hours
* Outside talks -- atleast 6 hours
* Other group talks -- the difference

## What happened with me

I was going to present the paper "Parallelizing Dynamic Programming Through Rank Convergence", but SVS vetoed it because it was not very PL oriented. So I chose "Safe & Efficient Gradual Typing for TypeScript" instead. 
I have included the presentation that I presented, which went pretty well.
